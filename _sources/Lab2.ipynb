    "**Update 7/5/23**: I realized my naive discrete logarithm function is a little more naive than I had intended.  In the implementation from the homework, we compute (for example) `pow(g, 100000, p)` in one step, and then `pow(g, 100001, p)` in the next step, and then `pow(g, 100002, p)` in the next step, and so on.  The modular exponentiation function is fast, but it's still a waste of computing power to compute the power \"from scratch\" each step.  Instead, we can use the fact that if we know $y := g^{100000} \\bmod p$ (for example), then we can simply compute `(g*y)%p` to find $g^{100001} \\bmod p$, and so on.  For this lab, you can either use the code template from Homework 2, 4g, or you can adjust the algorithm to this \"multiply the previous value by g and then reduce modulo p\" algorithm that I just described.  The algorithm described here will be a little faster than the algorithm from Homework 2."
