Use the Navigation menu on the left to find the course content, which includes screenshare notes from the Zoom lectures as well as the Python notebooks (that were shared using Deepnote).

The class was largely based on the first three chapters of Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman's [*An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography*, 2nd edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-1711-2), along with some of the Vigen√®re cipher material from Section 5.2.
